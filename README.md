# spring-6-reactive-web-client
Examples of Reactive Programming with Spring Framework.

MongoDB runs on mongodb://localhost:27017
Runs as a service on port 27017

This projects needs as well the spring-6-reactive-mongo backend project running on port 8080

In Unit Test we are using the TestContainer within Docker which requires Docker Desktop installed. In that case the port does change with each test.

This repository has examples from my course [Reactive Programming with Spring Framework 5](https://www.udemy.com/reactive-programming-with-spring-framework-5/?couponCode=GITHUB_REPO_SF5B2G)
